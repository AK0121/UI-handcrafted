# 🎨 UI-Handcrafted

Welcome to **UI-Handcrafted** — a growing collection of pixel-perfect, hand-coded UI components and layouts built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

This is not your average component library.  
This is where design precision meets dev obsession — crafted, not copied.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This is my personal design lab, where I:

- Recreate beautiful UIs from **Dribbble**, **Behance**, and real-world inspiration
- Improve my **frontend mastery** with modern stacks like Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind
- Practice responsive layouts, animations, typography, and design systems
- Push regular GitHub commits to stay sharp and consistent

Each folder = 1 complete micro project, ready to study, remix, or deploy.
